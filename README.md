# The Analysis for Glassdoor Job Postings - Data Analyst
>  Scraping, cleaning, and visualizing the data from Glassdoor

## The Goal of this Project
In this project, I scraped over 3000 job postings for data analysts from Glassdoor. Since the website for Glassdoor is dynamic, I scraped the jobpostings using Selenium in Python.
After finishing scraping the data, I cleaned it using Python and rearranged the data in the format for the relational database in order to store it in the SQL.
Then, I made some visualization for the data using Tableua. Through the process, I showed how to scrape, clean, store, and visualize the data.
